"""Single source of truth for an object's HTTP content headers.

Every cloud object the platform stores must carry a correct ``Content-Type``
and a sane ``Content-Disposition`` — at *write* time (baked onto the S3
object), at *re-stamp* time (the backfill that fixes already-written
objects), and at *read* time (the streaming download path). Historically
the write path set neither, so every object landed as
``binary/octet-stream`` and public CDN URLs downloaded instead of rendering.

This leaf module is stdlib-only (``mimetypes`` + ``urllib``) so it can be
imported from both ``backends/`` and ``cloud_sync/`` with zero circular-import
risk. ``cloud_sync/download_stream.py`` re-exports the read-side helpers from
here so write-time, read-time, and backfill-time decisions are provably
identical and can never drift.
