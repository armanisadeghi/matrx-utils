"""Core protocol + Pydantic models for the file-analysis platform.

Every detector implements ``Detector`` and produces a ``DetectorResult``.
The dispatcher is the only thing that knows the registry; detectors are
black boxes that consume a ``PipelineContext`` and emit a result.

This module is file-type-agnostic. PDF-specific detectors live in
``matrx_utils.file_handling.specific_handlers.pdf.analyze.*``. Image,
audio, etc. detectors will live in their own sibling subpackages.

    EVENT-LOOP SAFETY CONTRACT (read before adding a detector):

    Detector work is almost always CPU-bound — PyMuPDF page parsing, pixmap
    rendering, hashing, regex sweeps. If that work runs directly on the
    asyncio event loop it BLOCKS the entire single-process server: no other
    request is served, no DB connection can be acquired, heartbeats stop. On
    2026-06-04 a single ``page_classification`` run held the loop for 82s and
    took the whole production server down (acquires timed out even though the
    pool had idle connections — the loop itself was frozen).

    The platform makes that class of failure structurally impossible:

    - **Default path (preferred):** implement the synchronous ``analyze()``.
      The base ``run()`` offloads it to a worker thread via ``asyncio.to_thread``
      so the loop stays free no matter how slow the file is. ``analyze()`` runs
      OFF the loop — it MUST NOT touch event-loop-bound resources (no awaiting,
      no asyncpg, no httpx client created on the main loop). Open your own
      PyMuPDF ``Document`` from ``ctx.bytes_in_memory`` inside ``analyze()`` and
      close it before returning — never share a Document across detectors
      (PyMuPDF Documents are not thread-safe).

    - **Async path (only when you genuinely await):** override ``run()``
      directly. Keep the CPU sections (PyMuPDF parsing, rendering, OCR image
      prep) inside ``asyncio.to_thread`` / ``run_in_cpu_executor`` and do ONLY
      the real ``await`` (injected async provider / persistence) on the loop.

    The dispatcher runs detectors sequentially within a cost-class bucket, so
    ``ctx.cache`` access from the offloaded thread is race-free.
