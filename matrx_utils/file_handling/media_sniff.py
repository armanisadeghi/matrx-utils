"""MIME-type sniff-and-rewrite at the upload boundary.

Every endpoint that accepts a user-uploaded file SHOULD route the bytes
through ``sniff_mime_type`` before writing. The rules:

1. Reject ``application/octet-stream`` from the client claim — try to
   produce a real type via magic-byte + filename guess.
2. Detect HTML / SVG bytes uploaded under a benign image MIME and coerce
   to ``application/octet-stream`` (forces download — prevents XSS via
   uploaded "image").
3. Fall back to filename-extension guess when the claim is missing.
4. Final fallback is ``application/octet-stream`` so the engine still
   accepts the bytes; downstream callers can decide whether to reject.

The function is platform-level (not specific to images) so the asset
endpoint, the file-upload endpoint, and any future media endpoint share
the same coercion logic. Ships in matrx-utils so every host that runs
cloud-sync gets the same MIME canonicalisation behaviour for free.
