"""Asset / AssetVariant wire shape — the canonical response for media uploads.

This is the *one* response shape every media endpoint returns. The host

rows via ``FileService.build_asset_envelope`` / the urn-minter primitive.

    This is what any client (frontend, another service, an embedded

    to the richer file-browser row (``FileRecord`` in aidream) or the
    multi-variant ``Asset`` envelope. It carries only what a client can
    actually act on:

      1. ``file_id``  — the ID. From it, everything else is fetchable, and
                        it round-trips straight back as ``MediaRef.file_id``.
      2. ``url``      — ALWAYS renderable (CDN when public, signed-inline
                        otherwise). Bind to <img>/<video> directly.
      3. ``cdn_url``  — permanent public CDN URL (public files only).
      4. ``signed_url`` + ``signed_url_expires_at`` — the expiring link and
                        the ms-epoch it dies, so the client refreshes ahead
                        of expiry without parsing X-Amz params.
      5. ``download_url`` — attachment-disposition signed URL (Download btn).
      6. display metadata the client renders: ``file_name``, ``mime_type``,
         ``size_bytes``, ``visibility``, ``thumbnail_url``.

    🚫 What it DELIBERATELY OMITS — the whole point of this shape:
      - ``storage_uri`` / ``file_uri`` — the native ``s3://bucket/owner/key``
        location. A client can do NOTHING with it; exposing it is pure
        info-disclosure. It is a server-only column and MUST NEVER cross a
        client boundary. Enforced at the DB (column REVOKE + a realtime
        publication that excludes it) and by ``scripts/audit_api_types.py``.
      - ``file_path`` (the virtual folder path) — belongs on the file-browser
        row, not on a bare reference; navigation shapes carry it, refs don't.
      - internals: ``owner_id``, ``checksum``, ``current_version``,
        ``parent_folder_id``, lineage/derivation fields, raw ``metadata``.

    Populate via ``SyncEngine.build_urls_for_record_async`` for the URL
    flavours — never hand-mint URLs. Lives in matrx-utils so every host
    consumes the identical contract.
