"""Periodic cleanup of abandoned TUS resumable uploads.

When a TUS client (browser, agent, anything) creates a multipart upload and
never finalizes / aborts it (browser tab closed, network disappeared, OS
killed the process), the `cld_uploads_inflight` row sits with
``status='in_progress'`` and the S3 multipart upload remains open. Each
abandoned multipart is real ongoing AWS storage cost — S3 charges for
uploaded parts until they're completed or aborted.

This module provides the cleanup loop that runs periodically (typically
hourly) and:

1. Finds every row where ``status='in_progress' AND expires_at < now()``.
2. For each row, calls :meth:`TUSSessionManager.abort_async` which performs
   BOTH the S3 ``AbortMultipartUpload`` call AND the DB transition to
   ``status='aborted'`` atomically (well, sequentially — but together).
3. On per-row failure, logs and continues — one bad row can't block the
   rest of the sweep.

This is the **active S3 + DB cleanup**, distinct from the
``InFlightRegistry`` watchdog that only flips the DB status. The watchdog
serves as the alert/visibility layer; this module is the actual janitor.

Usage (from a host application like aidream):

    from matrx_utils.file_handling.cloud_sync.transports.tus_cleanup import (
        run_tus_cleanup_loop,
    )

    # In your FastAPI lifespan or equivalent:
    cleanup_task = asyncio.create_task(
        run_tus_cleanup_loop(file_manager, interval_secs=3600)
    )

Why this lives in matrx-utils, not in aidream
---------------------------------------------
The cleanup is independent of any host-app concept and operates purely
through the matrx-utils ``SyncEngine`` + ``TUSSessionManager`` APIs.
Bundling it with the TUS implementation means every project that imports
the TUS transport gets the matching cleanup loop for free.
