"""File-mutation audit events.

Every meaningful file mutation is recorded to the canonical activity log
(``platform.activity_log`` via the ``platform.log_activity`` RPC).
``default_audit_logger`` is a host-injectable callable hosts wire via
``configure_audit_logger(default_audit_logger)``.

Producers call ``fire_audit_event(event_type, payload)`` after a
successful mutation — it invokes whatever logger the host configured
(aidream wires ``audit_bridge.emit_file_audit_event``) and is a no-op
on standalone installs.

(The legacy ``cld_events`` outbox + ``cld_webhooks`` dispatcher pair was
RETIRED in the 2026 DB canonicalization — the outbox was graveyarded,
nothing produced or consumed it, and no subscriber-management surface was
ever shipped. File audit now goes straight to ``platform.activity_log``.)
