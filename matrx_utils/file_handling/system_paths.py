"""SystemPathRegistry — the single source of truth for system-managed paths.

Anything the system writes automatically — AI generations, scraper output,
derived variants, thumbnails, ephemeral previews — MUST request its
folder path through this registry. Hand-crafted paths under user-namespace
folders are forbidden: they pollute user libraries, bypass retention
policies, and make audit / cleanup impossible.

Two top-level roots:

    generations/    — content the system *produced* (LLM output, image
                      generation, TTS audio, video generation, etc.).
                      Provenance: model + prompt is in metadata; the
                      bytes did not exist before the system created them.

    system-files/   — content the system *derived* or *fetched* (variants
                      from a master, thumbnails, ephemeral previews,
                      scraper output, redaction renders, etc.). Provenance:
                      derived from or about other content.

Anything in cld_files NOT under these prefixes is user-owned. Quota /
retention / audit jobs use this split to apply the right policy.

Register a feature once at import time:

    from matrx_utils.file_handling import register_system_folder

    AI_IMAGES = register_system_folder(
        "ai_images",
        root="generations/images",
        description="LLM / diffusion image-generation outputs.",
    )

Use it everywhere afterward:

    path = AI_IMAGES.path(filename)
    # → "generations/images/sunset-over-mountains-1747266537.jpg"

Or by name (when the registration site is upstream):

    AI_IMAGES = get_system_folder("ai_images")
    path = AI_IMAGES.path(*segments)
